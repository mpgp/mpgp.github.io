Простой и интуитивно понятный      интерфейс позволяет работать с приложением любому пользователю, имеющему начальные навыки общения с компьютером. Приложение      поддерживает интерфейс пользователя на основе меню, ориентированный на использование клавиатуры и манипулятора-мышь.    Порядок выполнения приложения, после того, как сервер успешно запущен:          Если пользователь не зарегистрирован, то надо пройти регистрацию;      Если пользователь уже зарегистрирован, то авторизоваться по логину и паролю;      авторизовать пользователя по логину и паролю;      Приступить к обмену сообщениями между пользователями чата.        После перехода на сайт, пройдем регистрацию по кнопке «SIGN UP», от пользователя требуется указать логин и пароль, и      выбрать один из предложенных аватаров.    TODO: PLACE  HERE    Далее переходим в главную комнату, где осуществляется сам обмен сообщениями.    TODO: PLACE  HERE    Если пользователь хочет написать личное сообщение, то надо лишь нажать на другого пользователя в списке.    TODO: PLACE  HERE    Обмен в общей комнате осуществляется еще проще, в поле «Message..» пользователь пишет сообщение и отправляет его всем      участникам чата по нажатию на кнопку с изображением бумажного самолетика.    TODO: PLACE  HERE    Для того, чтобы выйти из приложения, требуется нажать в правом верхнем углу на выбранный пользователем аватар и выбрать      пункт «Logout». Далее закрыть вкладку в браузере с чатом.          Выводы по главе        Разработан интерфейс приложения, написан код приложения. Составлено руководство программиста и пользователя. Проведена      отладка и тестирование приложения.
